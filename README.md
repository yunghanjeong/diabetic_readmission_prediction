# diabetic_readmission_prediction
This repository is to store classification models to predict hospital readmissions regarding patients with diabetes

## Business Problem
Determining treatment effectiveness within diabetic pateints is an ardous process. Therefore, predicting readmission possibility of patients would allow care-providers to determine treatment qaulity, effectiveness, and prepare further treatment plans if necessary. Also, classifying high risk patients would determine ineffective or errorneous treatments, reducing treatment risks in the future. This prediction model will provide insight to treatment effecitiveness, cost reduction method, and reduced medical risks to careproviders. Hospitals and insurance angency can utilize this model to increase logistical and financial support for highly effective treatments and high risk patients.
